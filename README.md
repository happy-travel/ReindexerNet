ReindexerNet is a .NET binding ~~[and connector](# "not yet implemented")~~ for embeddable in-memory document db [Reindexer](https://github.com/Restream/reindexer). It is still in alpha state and there are a lot of works to do. So using in a prod environment is not recomended.

Currently only embedded mode has been implemented for win-x64 and linux-x64. And If you have any questions about Reindexer, please use [main page](https://github.com/Restream/reindexer) of Reindexer. Feel free to report issues and contribute about ReindexerNet.
